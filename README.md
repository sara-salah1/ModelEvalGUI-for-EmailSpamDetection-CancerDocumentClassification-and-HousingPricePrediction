# ModelEvalGUI-for-EmailSpamDetection-CancerDocumentClassification-and-HousingPricePrediction

**ModelEvalGUI** is a versatile graphical user interface (GUI) application that facilitates the evaluation of machine learning models for three different domains: Email Spam Detection, Cancer Document Classification, and Housing Price Prediction. This project is designed to be user-friendly and flexible, allowing users to choose from various models and evaluation methods for their specific dataset.

## Features

- **Multi-Domain Support**: ModelEvalGUI supports three distinct domains: Email Spam Detection, Cancer Document Classification, and Housing Price Prediction. You can easily choose your dataset of interest.

- **Model Selection**: For each domain, you can select from a range of machine learning models, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Naive Bayes (for Email Spam Detection), and K-Means for Cancer Document Classification and Linear Regression for Housing Price Prediction.

- **Evaluation Methods**: Choose between accuracy and confusion matrix as evaluation methods to assess the performance of your selected models.

- **Plotting**: Visualize the evaluation results using the built-in plotting functionality. You can view accuracy or confusion matrices for one or more selected models simultaneously.

- **Model Persistence**: Save your trained machine learning models for later use. ModelEvalGUI provides the option to load these models directly within the application to evaluate and display their accuracy.

## Usage

1. **Select Dataset**: Choose from three datasets - EmailSpam.csv, CancerDocument.csv, and HousingPrice.csv - using the combo box.

2. **Choose Models**: Based on the selected dataset, a list of available models will appear in the form of checkboxes. Select one or more models for evaluation.

3. **Select Evaluation Method**: Pick either accuracy or confusion matrix as the evaluation method.

4. **Plot Results**: Click the "Plot" button to visualize the evaluation results in the figure area.


## Requirements

- Python 3.9
- Required Python libraries (scikit-learn, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, seaborn, emoji, beautifulsoup4, nltk)
